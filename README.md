# Election Analysis: Data from small county 

## Background
Tom and Seth hired by US election commissioner officer. They've been tasked to help the commissioner generate a vote count report in efforts to yield efficient and readily accessible election data for the U.S. congressional districts,senatorial districts and other local elections. Tom and Seth decided to leverage Python scripts to automate the election process. 

#### Data Requirements:  
* Voter turnout for each county
* Percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* Identify the counties with the highest turnout
* Total number of votes cast
* Total number of votes for each candidate
* Percentage of votes for each candidate
* Identify the winner of the election based on the popular vote


## Overview Election Audit Project 

The purpose of this project is to assist Tom and Seth display a few sample data to the comissioner that meets his requirements. With the Python script, the commissioner can easily run the script to help tell a data driven story of the election results. This is achieved by using for loops and conditional statements with membership and logical operators to find the requested results then print the results to the command line.
